# About me

Hello, my name is Erin. I'm based in Portland, Oregon, where I've lived for the past three years. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Marketing from the University of Washington, with a focus on digital strategy and consumer behavior. Currently, I work in the marketing industry as a Marketing Manager, specializing in brand development and digital campaigns.

Recently, I’ve been leading a project that redefined the brand identity for a mid-sized tech startup, resulting in a 30% increase in brand recognition and a significant boost in customer loyalty. Another recent initiative I spearheaded was a social media campaign for a national nonprofit, which successfully raised awareness and funds through targeted content and influencer partnerships.

In the coming year, my goal is to expand my expertise in data-driven marketing and explore the intersection of AI and consumer insights to create even more personalized and effective campaigns. I’m also passionate about mentoring up-and-coming marketers and hope to take on more leadership roles within my organization.

Outside of work, I love exploring the vibrant food scene in Portland, practicing yoga, and volunteering with local environmental groups. I’m also an enthusiastic traveler, always looking for my next adventure, whether it’s a weekend road trip or an international journey to experience different cultures.
